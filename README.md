# YAKTable
Yet Another KnockoutJS Table

## Dependencies
- knockout
- knockout mapping
- knockout validation
- jquery
- jquery validate
- sweetalert2

A work in progress of recreating the jquery.jtable.js but for knockoutjs. This "library" allows to not only shows results in a table but also the complete CRUD process by creating a modal form for the create/update process and a confirmation window for the delete.

I just this just as a proof of concept, if you want to use it for production, keep in mind that there are other alternatives that you should check before.
